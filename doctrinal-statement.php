                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of
                                God. We believe in the divine inspiration and supreme authority of the Old and
                                New Testament Scriptures, which are the written Word of God – fully trustworthy
                                for faith and conduct.
                                </li>
                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son,
                                and Holy Spirit.</li>
                                
                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe in the incarnation and deity of God’s eternal Son, the Lord Jesus
                                Christ in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, and in His miracles. We believe that
                                Jesus Christ was truly divine and truly human, yet without sin.</li>
                                
                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe in the vicarious death and atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the
                                cross: dying in our place, paying the price of sin and defeating evil, so reconciling
                                us with God through His shed blood.</li>
                                
                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe in the bodily resurrection of Christ from death, His ascension to the
                                right hand of the Father, His present reign and mediation as the only Savior of the
                                world, and His imminent personal return in power and glory.</li>
                                
                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe that the justification of sinners is solely by the grace of God through
                                faith in Christ.</li>
                            <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, who leads us to repentance,
                                unites us with Christ through new birth, empowers our discipleship, and enables
                                our witness. We believe that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit enables the believer
                                to live a godly life and that the infilling of the Holy Spirit empowers the believer
                                to be a witness for Christ.</li>
                            
                             <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved
                                            unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of
                                            damnation.</li>
                     <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe that all believers are united in our Lord Jesus Christ and belong to one
                            body. We believe in the church – the body of Christ both local and universal. We
                            believe in the priesthood of all believers – given life by the Spirit and endowed
                            with the Spirit’s gifts to worship God, proclaim the gospel, and make disciples.</li>    
                            
                       <li style=" padding-bottom: 15px;"> We believe in the personal and visible return of Jesus Christ to fulfil the purposes
                                of God, who will raise all people to judgement – bring eternal life to the
                                redeemed and eternal condemnation to the lost, and establish a new heaven and
                                new earth.</li>
