                        <p class="featured-heading-textp">Association of Independent Christian Colleges and Seminaries (AICCS) is a professional, faithbased, non-profit, educational corporation chartered in the State of Missouri to found, develop,
                            strengthen, and accredit Christian schools of ministry which offer in-classroom and on-line
                            courses, tracks, and degrees.                            
                        </p>
                        <p class="featured-heading-textp">Based on our status with AICCS, about a thousand institutions worldwide accept students with
                            credits and/or degrees from Spirit Brood. Some USDE accredited schools also accept our
                            credentials. You can check our status with AICCS, as well as other AICCS schools that accept our credentials

                            the discretion of the accepting institution.

                        <p class="featured-heading-textp">USDE accreditation is not necessary for the theological degrees which we offer.
                                Generally speaking, people working in ministry positions do not need a USDE
                                accredited degree. However, individuals seeking employment in governmentlicensed positions such as public school teachers, state- licensed psychologists
                                or psychiatrists, and non-church-related counselors will more than likely need
                                USDE accredited degrees.
                            </p>
                            <p class="featured-heading-textp">If you are pursuing education at Spirit Brood Theological Seminary with the
                                        intent of obtaining employment or for some other reason, you should check
                                        with that organization BEFORE applying for enrollment. Spirit Brood
                                        Theological Seminary assumes no liability of any kind.</p>

                        <ul class="featured-heading-textp">
                            <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">There is secular education and there is religious education. Secular schools
                                seek secular accreditation, while religious institutions receive sacred or
                                ecclesiastic accreditation—each by their own peers.</li>
                            <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Religious institutions need no secular accreditation because they offer no
                                secular degrees. Religious schools like ours are, therefore, not legally
                                required to become accredited by USDE.</li>
                                
                            <li>The US law of separation of Church and State also agrees with this. We are,
                                therefore, not required by the law to seek accreditation from associations
                                that are “recognized” by an agency of the federal government.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="featured-heading-text2" style="font-weight: 500;">Why not become accredited by the Department of Education?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="featured-heading-textp">Any school that is accredited by the government’s Department of Education is regulated by the
                            government. The government therefore has a say in what can and cannot be taught by the school,
                            among other things. These are often based on secular standards that seek to silence certain
                            scriptural truths. Our standards are not secular and cannot be judged by secular standards!
                            
                            </p>
                            <p class="featured-heading-textp">As we find in 1 Corinthians 2:14 “But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God:
                                for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
                                discerned.” Therefore a state agency is not able to determine if a spiritually directed learning
                                institution is meeting the mandates of the Bible!
                                </p>
                        <p class="featured-heading-textp">DOE Accreditation has many benefits for both educational institutions and students, but it is
                            neither a guaranty nor is it the sole criterion of an excellent education. While Spirit Brood
                            Theological Seminary is not accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of
                            Education, our programs have been reviewed and certified by the Association of Independent
                            Christian Colleges and Seminaries, based in Missouri USA. Further, we are duly registered as a
                            Religious Education institution with Wyoming's Secretary of State.
